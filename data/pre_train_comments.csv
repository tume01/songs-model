always keep eye person love watching see sort reaction similar feeling ultimately doesnt completely confess love convinces sort similar effort see person dream think losing religion represents emotional impact love entire life whatever center completely change pursues love able make sacrifice risk necessary pursue true love people already touched think song strange mental dichotomy constructed many religion constant second guessing criticizing lead internal turmoil self hate concentrating negative life accepting religion individual start resembling definition schizophrenia literally “of split mind” inserting artificial hyperactive conscience keep track sin individual think one important line song “every whisper every waking hour im choosing confession trying keep eye you” speaks constant mental process continuously tracking judging every thought action something “wrong” need confessed instead living life person constantly selfanalyzing thought action pathetic like “hurt lost blinded fool” say “thats corner” thats many child punished “thats spotlight” speaks stage confident followed guilt shame religion make feel guilty insightful exercise zen watch thought really angry mess might hear thought say “you really screwed idiot known better” interesting part exercise notice pronoun talk use word “i” “me” talk others use word “you” thought head call “you” come put look third line song “and me” hmmm think talking supercritical conscience look line “ thought heard laughing thought heard sing think thought saw try” looking sin “where good time sin well saw try thats sin thinking it” yes religion forbid singing outside church declare thinking thing sin — like coveting neighbor wife good — thought crime quite literally religion forbids singing church every time get stage “losing religion” figuratively “thats spotlight losing religion” could speak expressing stage realizing talent ability filling seat “gift invisible being” find drift away religious idea brainwashed believing child 99 new religious people child forced attend parent happy adult education understanding science decide blue become religious adult convert coming another religion marriage rest convert due trauma loss loved one job war crime victim 12 step program etc need belief system cling order make sense world think song speaks line “ consider slip brought knee — failed” also find interesting criticism religion become stronger stanza stop say “oh ive said much” one basically say religion making treat like “hurt lost blinded fool” another talk religious belief fantasy “what fantasy come flailing around” say “oh ive said much” culture religious people constantly told people polite discus religion public okay try convert scaring heck tale eternal damnation people want rationally discus religion via science logic etc frowned upon people rationally discussed religion church would dwindle size interesting note last stanza follows “ive said much” “i havent said enough”

croon pulsing sensuality music smooth poetry word listen heart she’s left empty space inside heart weed take root weed take root lotus flower slowly gloriously unfurled set free pained convulsed contortion dance shaking loss cuz want moon upon stick see see set free baiting back song want want want shaking groove quiet mouse cat’s away dance around pit darkness beneath kick habit head listen heart want waaaant he’ll set free he’ll set free slowly slowly unfurl lotus flower listen heart number thom radioheads song show understanding buddhism im sure nothing chose lotus type flower lotus pivotal buddhism seat buddha one becoming buddha also often compared opening lotus blossom also lotus grows mud id like get away whole sexual innuendo thing minute really break song reference music video accompanies song pretty special even radiohead buddhist regard yes lotus flower title yes one eight auspicious symbol religion whats important something much simplistic letting go begin line shape pocket attempt yorke explain exactly want shape different everyone invisible want believe never see could wish u see way see life music make part time listen pocket one pouring soul music revealing much heart fact done unbelievably truthful yet enigmatic lyric accompanying music video see see highly unlikely also notice music video unfurls much like lotus flower would real sense becoming blossoming one song go along notice use color strictly black white reason definitely shrink disappear likely greatest fear yet readily admits think give tom yorke greatest joy people listen listen hard real fing hard maybe one moment might begin grasp complexity trying reveal artistically diction yet dont like sound take another stupid sex song thats hitting billboard top 40 say slip groove cut cut place somewhere make sense inside mind cut thinking weve figured trying say point well feel content song like got figured driving insane thats there empty space inside mythoms heart weed take root ill set free artist try explain regard much want say feel though one could ever understand well continue whats tearing apart sing beautiful song nice sounding u set u free thats needsound beat dont think 200 meaning every line song rocker rocker thom yorke whenever listens heart always continues make music u listen never fully grasp way could wish slowly unfurl way pace lotus flower cause want moon upon stick able shine bright light everyone darkness could see see see could see truth probably right highly complex yet cant regardless cant kick habit giving heart society music replaced growing weed feed fast ballooning head enjoy music conception actually saying listen heart suck doesnt next come shrink quiet mouse straightforward pressure implored think critically given brutal truthby asked fight someone else belief many shrink quiet mouse cat away long nobody dont feel fear getting caught stealing cheese however youde like interpret well case society want second time say see say bird light float room likely favorite line song serf nicely accompaniment moon bird light likely reference star see brightly beautiful flying bird see room see room perhaps poster mr yorke go look star see see probably want moon upon stick illuminate darkness beneath dance around pit artfully word music even loses heart drive insane want end still listen heart let go hopefully one day see see really trying say first got unfurl though ok first time using site guess say everyone already know radiohead probably one interesting band consider lyrical meaning like many fav artist mine eg eddie vedder pearl jam feel like lyric made intentionally abstract listener apply background understanding interpret perhaps bit personal truth well hidden line artist often inspired write thought experience second theme feel also struggle wanting innocently love partner headsup die hard thom fan try frame aspect personal life dont get crazy mad ok art eye beholder right maybe science like roscharch test one asked interpret shadow according thought matter say basically got vibe lyric hearing song actually read wiki explanation later regarding sensual abandon moment music thereabouts think explanation far interesting perhaps wiki page meaning le decoy thom throwing around read see mean major theme soured worn love narcissism borderline personality megalomania feel conversation person trait cope finality loss lovethis losing love losing control also conversation lost love even struggle understand loss alternate powertrips ego defense sound like could 2 possible meaning first sound like wanting one cant want letting go know cant buddhism acceptance coveting cant want sleeping one easier finding love isnt weed take root original use lotus flower

"song comparing suicide martyrdom verse wake grab brush put little make talking hidden story bible hiding bad thing never told christ bible go create another fable another religious story chorus saying fact jesus could looked viewpoint suicide thrid verse father hand commend spirit father hand forsaken two seven last word christ direct definition chop suey dish filled mix leftover meaning leftover story bible never heard whole band never stated official meaning song fan interpret song well interpretation lot interpretation heavily religious tied mine slightly different song someone really want kill self everyone around person doesnt understand going lengthy bear life grab brush put little makeup hide scar fade away shakeup everyone else doesnt see depressedtraumatized person really verse repeat wanted end line symbolizes everyone else blaming person taking control hisher life whyd leave key table wanted key symbolize tool control person life heshe left anyone take wanted hide scar couldnt even take control whats happening life prechorus section hear dont think trust self righteous suicide change tempo new instrument symbolizes another person talking suicidal person trying explain heshe enough would best life ended hear cry angel deserve die later father forsaken symbolizes person looking world seeing injustice cruelty many people claim angel reality done horrible thing deserve die people well thinking many bad thing happening world could god let happen could god forsake u could forsake definition chop suey chinese dish made lot mixed ingredient similar modern society mixed view suicide interview system said wanted put word suicide name didnt everyone would censor named chop sueycide play word daron malakian system guitarist stated interview song regarded differently depending pas everyone deserves die like die drug abuse might say deserved abused dangerous drug hence line cry angel deserve die yeah song someone contemplating attempting suicide album version even hear serj say start suicide mark great artist great song mean different thing different listener previous post correctly pointed biblical reference jesus cruxification jesus last word question doubt god nonchristian could view jesus man orchestrated death ie selfrighteous suicide jesus doubting god end make u question whether jesus legacy messiah isnt fable youre christian faith tell otherwise thats fine make sure youre finding answer blindly following guidance others song us jesus story metaphor life apply life beginning lyric speak u wake every day untrue real self putting artificial surface creating fable might apply many previous posted suggestion abused wife drug abuser religious zelot etc think message song dont follow selfdestructive path without deeply questioning youre word life leading destruction somehow justify nothing suicide one blame ive read comment seems alot people way think obvious interpretation song verse based experience growing psychic physical abuse fosterfather hit right away similar line would hear verse perfectly nail terror pressure intensity father frustration rage who blaming child abusive behaviour wanted time father demand wake upstep man instead looking small shaken hide scar fade away shakeup strong put smiling mask act like nothing wrong ever happened wake grab brush put little makeup father acting like fear child depressionsadness provoking suspicion behaviour want hide child growing environment like likely able realize wrong father likely adapt father blame start accusing feeling shameful hiding thinking whatever happens something deserves becoming selfdestructive angel deserve die angel case refers innocent childrenvictims abuse chorus also seems familiar growing christian community usually mean youre thaught seek comfort jesus believe try describe paradox child interprets life forsaken let promise bible notionopposition would claim life acceptable life commends spirit life would become better though due childhood father mockery developed behaviour would make vulnerable social situation would easily find victim abuse school anyone would want boast upon believe compare try vain live father demand similar manner feel commends spirit vain bible question really blame anyone experienced something like turn back everything commit suicide felt guilty selfrighteous certainly felt deserved die get chill whenever hear song least way see extremely sad story song becomes really interesting youre able see concept true many level home domestic violence although one brilliant thing lyric like open personal interpretation read lot interpretation song many deep logical yet find single explanation cover every aspect lyric tried take song directly make conclusion heard go nothing beginning song talk person trying cover problem everyone else think totally fine know person going hard time talk want hide scar fade away shake fight see person trying hide outside grab brush put little makeup hide scarsbut course problem whatever may happen wont go away speaker state others dont understand selfrighteous suiside course wouldnt understand see outside cold troubled inside father stanza apparently quote jesus died u cross dont think stanza actually refers jesus first positive speaker talking god dad going die could command spirit dad doesnt make sense anyway think speaker angry god bringing much misfortune hence forsaken bit think living day day hide secret rest world keep bitting rear end sound like pretty sad life ask think handing spirit god hope god bring sort peace whyd leave key table line think symbolizes speaker although dont know one actually quoted thishas given life see key give access home vast majority leaving somewhere kind hint doesnt care enough keep track lifeline left someone find lastly cry angel deserve die line symbolizes death sad others perfect happy carefree guy kill okay song starting make sense fact armenian genocide riddled metaphor allusion first verse interpreted literally suicidal person hiding fact self harming broader sense give feeling hurry emergency still caught little mundane task liking putting makeup looking car key think people panicking realizing forced away home forever dont die heavy rifting sound remnant military attack maybe time verse literal second time day attack signified screamed di chorus think one suicide isnt literal wasnt literal last verse mean think selfrighteous suicide refers general martyrdom suicide bombing see martyrdom one responsible death refuse compromise faith self righteous matyr belief righteous deed importance extends whole armenian people genocide ethic cleansing delivered ottoman like ethnic tension difference religion ottoman muslim armenian christian thats make genocide martyrdom angel deserving die refers innocent life shed tragedy verse appears priest someone asking tragedy could happen righteous people also deserving die part might reflect lack attention given massacre next verse idea martyrdom reiterated alluding jesus crucifixion forsaken part refers even though armenian believed righteous found deliverance end think song summed saying armenian killed belief like jew holocaust one gave damn armenian turk continue deny tragedy day ok probably mean absolutely shit reading book nod friend theory could mean think refers biblical story caine allow explain wake upeveryone town make weekly offering morning sunday assume cain fruit farmer brother abel cattle farmercain would sacrifice best fruit abel would sacrifice best cow god displeased caine gave much le brother hide scar fade away shakeupafter killing abel cain acted know happened whyd leave keyskids upon tablein case kid would make sense since cain killed abel altar offering go create another fablethe murder abel caine start one many well known biblical plot wanted tothis could something fact cain trying please god got hand could also reference religious fanatic dont think trust selfrighteous suicideno one including god thought cain done right thing cain probably knew best idea piss god offits practically suicide get cry angel deserve diecain really mad god punishing severely thinking punishment fit crime speak father hand commend spiritwhy forsaken methough direct quote jesus crucified hold decidedly weight cain cain actually forsaken god part punishment maybe isnt intended meaning songif intended meaning allwhich im starting doubt think pretty uncanny thing applied story dont get wrong though im insisting im right im putting 2 cent thinking maybe someone worth reading song suicide another commenter noted song originally called suicide record company made change thinking chopped word half sui suey phonetics sake exclamation point opinion icing cake saying record company look told u made happy songeff even right song start know one person band tell member song theyre playing next hear either drummer lead say okaysuicide like he giving cueokay going play song said agree commenter quoted lead singer song regarded differently depending pas suicide get heaven way die okay cant someone saved commit suicide guy putting makeup think cutting scar arm first stanza describes go keep hidden maybe us swiss army knife keychain key cut second stanza he replaying others response head like using makeup himi wanted putting arm wanted uh leave key table shit think reason left create another fable next part he little sarcastic say trust selfrighteous suicide make cry think im depressed make deserving die go heaven wanting kill angel every aspect end think he praying he asking god save commend spirit feel god forsaken creating giving feeling ultimately depression feel forsaken creator let everyone else heaven commends spirit long dont kill thats caveatbe saved youre okay saved commit suicide youre screwed thats personallyim interested see people think interpretation wow like meaning especially one guy dressed like angel come

acceptance finally couldnt take anymore ghost referring ideal getting famous without sacrificing art speaks middle maybe significant part song speaking directly ushis audience telling u finally sold soul sacrificed art making traditionally pop albumthat left home everything believed see star thats saying longer reason shouldnt famousthere nothing special star doesnt hear song sound like one made pop song sake getting bigso come let finally make interestingly us vocodermaking statement pop star dont actually talented use vocodersand somehow become popular song hears sound like one vocoder feel like sacrificed true art successful pop star end amazing thing come terrible night starting accept sold holding onto principal worth dying alone dried desert sun life matter youre never appreciated end saying dream past arthis past self best didnt listen younger self would hated became best get distance he finally accepted reality live artistic ideal he also finally happyhe feel successful acceptedand hard work finally paid people pretty bizarre interpretation song guess cool touch people different way listening song number time came see lyric pretty obvious song entirely writer conflicted feeling touring musician seeking fame missing love life left girl behind well family he sure worth trouble even though come great perk highlight night wish lip could build castle night wish theyd fall time want break superstardom time wish whole music career would implode go home live normal life still wake still see ghost oh lord im still sure stand he haunted memory girl left behind thought leaving behind seeking fame would find purpose life hasnt happened boy war waiting dont break rule already music business vicious competition he sometimes enthusiastic trying succeed theyre trying make using old boring technique like touring giving interview think need differentiate new creative way never one believe hype save black white try twice hard im half liked come jack style band sometimes get great review try live next review come worse despite see others copying trying capitalize success see star see star thats hear song sound like swan people amazed hypnotizing beauty star night sky feel way listening music well guy five minute im bored ten year im sure anybody understands he trouble keeping enthusiasm performance doesnt feel like audience getting he trying say heart breaking sister con called love look nephew eye man wouldnt believe amazing thing come terrible night think say lie clear sister going divorce despite pain relationship gave wonderful son he amazed apparent contradiction night wouldnt believe dream called wed agree best didnt listen best get distance oh go back talking girl left behind begged come visit doesnt want kind relationship think need stay apart heal breakup think lot thinking song simplest form without thinking much examining lyric needed cruel love love treated badly way completely changed corrupted much even know stand fro anymorehe still see girl broke heart everywhere go still see ghost try twice hard im half liked saying cant believe put everything relationship still couldnt love way deserved could go much depth every line biggest line prove point also need point important line validate stance song heart breaking sister con call love saying much bad luck love feel even worse sister convinced love man bailed got pregnant even though said loved song definitely cruel love night first foremost antiwar song written perspective young soldier presumably iraq clear reference dying dried desert sun well 10 year supported phrase boy war well military sound drum beat clearly borrowed simon garfunkels cecilia although fun acknowledged influence soldier feel disillusioned wonder stand multiple time throughout song gaze sky see star lost faith heaven power larger due seen martyr bed religious reference presumably young girl sacrificing make money prostituting soldier aware using sex escape disillusionment war also left girl home appears cheated wonder forgotten meaning cheated think often suggested seeing ghost night realizes better dont contact away young soldier miss mom dad go meaning felt compelled join military reason explained song realizes mistake fight doesnt seem meaningful purpose even bored whole experience think sister feel bad situation abusive relationship refers metaphor sometimes amazing blessing come terrible nightsthat perhaps day good coming war involved reference make nightyou wouldnt believe dream subtle brilliant reference song made famous simon garfunkel called last night strangest dream antiwar song written 1950 dream peace mankind young soldier night ultimately hoping even praying end song reflects disillusionment hope mostly agree gwright2 would like addchange first stanza think wish singing could bring want american dream time doesnt want exposure come famous second think conflicted liked unheard band life simpler maybe even fun time amazing new fan adore also new cash flow maybe never really wanted famous doesnt know anymore third want people break social norm aka stop worshiping famous people hate paparazzo exposure never bought celeb b tmz national

getting married go home sits window smile either hoping grab someone attention pretending father mckenzie preacher probably used primarily wedding service actual preaching isnt really wellattended spends night fixing clothes look good sermon one go care finale eleanor finally died leaving nothing name tombstone mckenzie one buried burial done hand shovel got dirt wipe nobody came funeral one saved sermon planned thats storyas meaning may simply lament people world one work place call people survey old lady willing take middle survey started talking talking husband died started cry thought wonder im one talked made sad cant help lonely people song reminds though one favorite song always feel bit uncomfortable hearing always seemed line lonely people come lonely people belong implicate listener accuse part cold inhumane society ive inspiration meaning song joined specifically could share inspiration read comment lot read none got hinted none got im going come right say song directed church song directed christianity general singing father mckenzie singing random individual happened church leader purpose song father mckenzie representation christianity ah look lonely people one saved yes hint connection father mckenzie eleanor rigby song saying anything together two might never even spoken outside usual church banter song suggesting connection father mckenzie eleanor rigby one saved father mckenzie busy selfrighteous busy writing word sermon one hear song boldfaced accusation selfrighteous overly religious refuse reach lonely people wonder come church song saying isnt enough friendly song saying long people especially religious people remain cold aloof eleanor rigbys world continue die buried along name person name important judeochristian value think father mckenzie eleanor meant together never two lonely people could together frequenting church worked one attended funeral came friend picked dirt throw sad lonely person never know close may someone else lonely sound crazy im great fan dickens whenever hear song think miss havisham especially beginning part unaquainted miss havisham character charles dickens great expectation good novel way jilted wedding day young girl heart broken stopped clock house time jilted shut window left everything old lady sits wedding dress veil wedding feast still sitting rotten dining room meanwhile exacts revenge men beautiful unattainable adopted daughter estella eleanor rigbys lonliness constant sort waiting state always bring miss havisham mind reading post got one bibliophile strange opinion literature lesson one remember walking hall juinor high school year back hundred people bumping pushing thinking wonder many time ive seen people yet ive still never seen im seeing first time thats walking hall see kind people everyone purpose walking class lonliest like fish bowl spektator think line father mckenzie writing word sermon noone hear eleanor rigby wait window wearing face keep jar door meaning full first one like thing hear see maybe someone spent time working never really see remember second one like job costomer always right always smile even though dont need dont want pretty depressing trying live life impressing others get image someone sitting run dark room looking window rather depressing scene door bell ring get greets guest surprised greeting smile go back sitting chair looking gloomy window obviously song lonely people seems eleanor rigby lonely single person often went church perhaps ease emptiness felt inside maybe even hoped make friend whilst church perhaps saw rice left people wedding often regretted never chance get married family wearing face keep jar door suggests like lonely people hid unhappiness whenever left house tried appear happy like everybody else window jar suggests outward attempt hide unhappiness didnt work well easy see window jar glass died church perhaps relates last place visited passed away perhaps even found dead inside church either natural cause maybe even suicide buried along name seems indicate last family relative sibling child continue family bloodline maybe last remaining rigby family circle nobody left carry surname uk tradition people buried closest relative throw handful dirt grave filled eleanor relative friend graveside father mackenzie felt sorry decided hence wiping dirt hand walk grave one saved perhaps sum father mackenzie feel nobody come church bury people opportunity help anybody problem feel like played part bettering somebody el life perhaps eleanor lonely committed suicide church would also alternative died church also father mackenzie feel guilty church talk try stop killing written tombstone name actually technically thats true tombstone inspiration fanatic agree largely paul song though paul john story differ wrote song paul remembers taking name eleanor actress worked help believe mckenzie alteration original name father mccartney however pointed paul year later cemetery john used get drunk rigby tombstone eleanor rigbys mention eleanor rigby believe mckenzie tombstone john mckenzie im mistaken possible name may caught paul fancy way subconscious recollection youth really love song philosophy minor make love even think beatles pointing unhappiness come first er likely nun janitor picking rice want get closer fm catholicism cant together implementing religion unhappiness also next part wearing face jar door referring makeup worn give illusion happiness putting front whenever public try happy like everyone else turn truly many unhappy people society well next part writing word one hear fm trying help others cant even help religion supposed make life better opposite noone come near sermon one hear however spite still blindly work hard something lost cause darning sock trying really thinking would realize unhappy change path life last part er dying give truthful yet sad example outcome future hold er never married buried along name might reading

barely ever comment clear anyways song called play crack sky joke — friend went concert recognized one singer band previous band cool song called crack sky jesse friend — one concert — got kick friend yelled “play crack sky” guy stage song title joke disguise watched many interview youtube let slip briefly song death specifically believe it’s father fisherman believe song immensely personal i’m sure really get concrete meaning that’s basic interpretation im looking song totally different lot check end big mystery seems cause go know want funeral keep u apartyou know aloneneed like water lung end basically think he deading someone mistreated way best friend girlfriend family member funeral metaphor dead person though he really alive person know theyre alonehas friend feel important thats felt could treat like shit first place saying know youthey want suggests feel really didnt care anyway oh one thingwhen lung filled water youre drowning need person need struggle bottom sea die end relationship someone wasnt great wrong word strand vertigo16 may wrong title came tough time believing mentioned coincidence could see jesse thinking song though man ship wished everyone else ship saved cant help think song wrote explain feeling love someone happiness important choice accept funeral death relationship im thinking issue girlfriend john tb issue im sure sent shockwaves friend im speaking experience lashed friend couldnt anything help stop happening view guy song talk said hed anything girl never really realized true actually thing fell apart however powerless show want funeral want die life know shed give one day give love repay debt positive could show perfect refuse willing die save make happy time fighting fact willing disappear life make happy nothing wouldnt

long island believe would make sense writer maybe lacey alluded thing beachy sent so call quarter past four morning storm broke second anchor line four month sea four month calm sea pounded shallow tip montauk point four seems common number first verse say sent so call time also go say spent fourth month sea seems love affair lasted four month ironic suddenly went wrong 4 im assuming girlfriend left time didnt acknowledge absence time so call utter urgency see know seems leave absence relationship sailing smoothly reference montauk point strengthens long island theory also lead one think

"love immediate music globus music breathtaking lyric one though really sit well call end war rather incongruous list bloodshed europe history true mixed declaring new religious war calling divine help said war stanza clearly lay western world v insurgent shore unfortunately take mean immigrant europe even bigger antiimmigration issue u point new crusade religious war insurgent imported shore western world gripped fear mother battle clause obvious reference terrorism would ok condemning first line suggests child threw make revenge attack decendants dispossessed return bomb strapped chest caliphate reference blatantly muslim reference there hate life death hate emerging new caliphate course bomb case obviously nuclear drop bomb end fight never yet never line completely place thats generally taken reference holocaust call end racism genocide use line immediately call nuclear war weird best song call divine intervention finally put end war bloodshed id fine see clearly call divine intervention yetanother religious war ensure christian europe dominance next thousand year mix 20th century please peace end almost wish could make mind song rara europa let kick as world could deal one call goddess europe put end 2000 year bloodshed could deal switching back forth like especially openly racist fashion well doesnt sit well amazing nature music behind adore song felt like post politically correct crowd moved began complaining racist song insensitive whatever someone european identifies nationalist song globus black parade essentially glorifies europe history ability pull despite odds europe go enemy simply islamic nation europe continent real sense world cultural continent used much much larger spanning northern african turkey syria golden age islam arose europe shrank enlightened nation conquered forcibly converted mass rape forced marriage ensued original western inhabitant lower eastern europe spain portugal decimated swallowed islamic horde horde reached northern france sent back song glorifies major battle took place europe main meaning warning islam speaks insurgent upon shore could mean number thing immigration europe actually european country however mass emigration turkey many asylum seeker illegal refugee leaving africa via boat mean song could referring dont think think likely song referring legal muslim perform cultural jihad jihadist return war syria war three thousand european muslim fighting syria right assad undoubtedly loose flee back europe large population veteran jihadist warrior living europe almost certainly attempt perform terrorist act french government publically spoken estimated potentially 800 people return syrian war conclusion song european warfare clear anti islam message think declaring song racist incorrect certainly anti islamic however like song good song remove kebab favorite topic song every single war ever fought europe first three quatrain conflict ranging hundred year war world war ii song progress middle east conflict new crusadesreligious warsinsurgents imported shore heaven help u part obviously soldier asking god aid battle enemy fourth line last stanza clearly refers world war iii drop bomb end fight really love song wanted first one write view dont want get debate dealing subject matter think song epic dont think heaven help u part asking help enemy interpret plea end fighting totally stupid believe heaven help u plea end fighting since song go heaven help battle victory upon u runningbul1 song war outcome perfect song unique background music rythm close eye let magic think song refers war battle taken place europe war tech changed im aramisaris arab muslim traveled several western country europe north america engineer profession however also like classic song middle east europe rhythm song absolutely superb singer excellent job delivering lyric however mean lyric criticism true talk past present bloody war history europe switch middle east clear anti muslim tone understand violent terrorist act committed person individual happened muslim living europe point raised 1 death tool civilian middle east result western intervention counted million see british human right group study iraq invasion 2there mention appeal pea “ drop bomb correctly meant nuclear” “will rule next thousand years” call 4th reich 3 yes song talked many past bloody battle europe middle east blood bath continuing make sensitive specially end dropping bomb calling victory god 4 mention atrocity zionist instance part europe history read history also using phrase “never again” mention thousand killed bosnia majority victim muslim want know look deeper group used wikipedia see member like lead composer yoav gorenan israeliborn american see picture fantastic tune delivered perfectly sorry racist anti muslim islamophobia well historically europe wasa religious country heaven help u battle bit may reflect band ideology could something would actually said european time war especially good ol day could said rest lyric really admit hard tell music gorgeous think song unusual lyric contains rather cry end war list europe long list war genocide broken seemingly desperate cry divine help finish uncharacteristic yell bomb dropped first three verse song undeniably look past agincourt waterloo broken cry divine help heaven help battle followed time look present problem pressing europe bolshevisks feudal lord face rising tide another verse cry help greater power time followed look europe possible future key part song look mostly europe war

sure part…maybe fighting like arguing wanted stay together heading break ‘water’ reaching west coast power line going could like jolt realizes aiming high expectation realize could last forever ‘dark blue’ nothing could love chorus three others time know feel see know he’s love one see crowded room ‘dark blue’ thats thought could mean something entirely different xp either way awesome song

"first im amazed people get political meaning song know art left broad interpretation song strike obvious relationship song still kudos went outside box said im also going project song think pretty good lock meaning behind hoodoo first hoodoo primary definition rock formation specifically large boulder held much thinner elongated rock structure like tootsie pop skinny paper stick matt clever bastard heavy relationship thats doomed fall apart two holding anyway whatever reason causing much stress pretty much amalgamation lot people already mentioned agree deadtex intro like beginning new love guitar solo first verse deal two meeting going better judgement decide go ahead pretend completely happy relationship regressing dream building new reality im guessing girl directed isnt quite board keep facade he trying assure protected trouble pain get frustrated cant let problem go even though he supportive saying choose path anyway make happy even mean leaving he reflecting everything fell apart still remaining supportive even offering take blow assume would take emotional toll fallen relationship course last verse pertains realization changed way help keep together could completely wrong government previously stated muse know really like western kind feeling got muse cant kept genre aweseome reminds nancy sinatra song bang bang something string guitar piano sound perfect going great album cake opinion excellent use instrumental variety differs rest album slow pace lazy relaxed vocal interesting aspect however lie possible interpretation surprisingly ambiguous lyric personal interpretation spoken former love interest come back life let start scratch forget reality let live dream together follow instinct shouldnt afraid time ill make sure dont get hurt cant see there need crisis everythings okay come relationship doomed ie tied railroad really set u freelet soul body fade away dream everything okay final verse confirms interpretation eye retrospective loved made mistake wasnt able better man leading end relationship song begs another chance try convince almost manipulate girl trusting yet there touch desperate hopelessness realizes he asking much satisfying interpretation seems work song politics vibe i’m getting could song written viewpoint leader voted overran anarchy making disastrous decision second half album anarchyan uprising city delusion climax hence song postmortem toppled leader hypothetically could bushblair refecting decision voter backlash “come life regress dream” ie look thing point view moment ”we hide build new reality draw another picture life could had” trying build new world introducing democracy country theory make world better place therefore drawing another picture hiding reality ”follow instinct choose path” voter backlashanarchy arised nobody wanted follow anymore people chose left path ”you never afraid youre protected trouble pain crisis eye again” leader asking public “well trying keep safe angry it’s like war broke country happened far away” ”taught come tied railroad” tied railroad metaphor disastrous situation ie iraq showing sign stabilising year attempt bring peace ”youll set u free watch soul fade away let body crumble away dont afraid take cold you” ie take responsibility that’s gone that’s job leader ”and ive recurring nightmare loved am” word he’s dreaming public would lay thought right thing genuinely good person iraq run smoothly casualty noone would complaining way know thing would turn bad leader human ”and missed opportunity better man” fairly self explanatory wondering could could done differently stuff something im thinking nerodragon think writer talking former lover love interest well want come back life miss old time even might good might said done something hurt feeling regret maybe done stuff crisis eye made fuss thing didnt even exist didnt understand still want want work thing need help figure thing last line indicate fear chance someone didnt want change misunderstanding interpreting person wrong way thats cheer love song definately say take blow taught come youll set u free one set u free let body crumble away body crumbling take cold take blow beautiful song sound like relationship issue end sound sort like could government muse never know correct lyric come life regress dream hide build new reality draw another picture life couldve follow instinct choose path never afraid youre protected trouble pain crisis eye come come tied railroad love set u free watch soul fade away body crumbling dont afraid take blow ive recurring nightmare loved missed opportunity better man alright thanks think song moving one life another getting tired unhappy life changing better one song think someone talking conscience come life regress dream person looking life seeing misery sorrow want change forget bad stuff hide build new reality person want hide misery past life build newer better life draw another picture life could person thinking would happen stayed way ie life could dont change follow instinct choose path opposed normally would person telling opposite moral better thing never afraid youre protected trouble pain crisis eye bit like conscience telling nothing fear good come change possibly cant sink lower cant get worse protected trouble pain ie bad cant get worse hardship protects anything horrible happening conscience also asks big deal change good taught come tied railroad person saying made like didnt think would bad later stage youll set u free watch soul fade away let body crumble away person asking conscience help changing fixing wrong think might destroy dont afraid take cold conscience renforces fact worry happen get better help person talking cold helping make tough decision need make ive
